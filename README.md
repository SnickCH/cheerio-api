# Cheerio API â€“ REST Interface

This project provides a simple REST API built with Node.js, Express, and Cheerio. It can be used to parse HTML content via HTTP requests. The API exposes a basic test endpoint for health checks and a main endpoint for HTML parsing.

## Disclaimer
- Project created on 2025-10-05. I only did a few tests
- This will be used in my own N8N workflows
- No support "as-is" and on your own risk


## Features

- Built on Node.js and Express
- Uses Cheerio for server-side HTML parsing
- REST interface for easy integration with tools like n8n
- Docker-ready for isolated deployments

  
## public image
- if you dont want to build your own local image, you can use the following one
Be Aware that I will not update the existing images. This is for my own usage - you are welcome to use it too.

```
snickch/cheerio-api:1.0.0-rc12   - Cheerio 1.0.0-RC12, with Express 4.18.2 (FROM Node20-alpine)
snickch/cheerio-api:1.1.2        - CHeerio 1.1.2, with Express 5.1.0 (FROM Node20-alpine)

```

## Security
- There is no security for any endpoint. It is designed to be used in your own environment only (for example: in the same network as N8N)
- The image will not be updated. They work for me and I don't want anything to change.
- New images with new versions may be created. If you wish to have a new version, feel free to open an issue (speficy exactly which version of Cheerio and Express you want to have, and why: Issues with the existing images or some new features that you want to use?)

## Endpoints

### 1. Test Endpoint `/hello`

A simple GET endpoint to verify that the container and the API are running.

**Request:**
```
GET /hello
```

**Example (Browser):**
```
http://localhost:4444/hello
```

**Response:**
```
Hallo von der Cheerio API!
```

---

### 2. Parsing Endpoint `/parse`

Parses provided HTML using a CSS selector.  
You send raw HTML and a selector in the body, and the API responds with the extracted data.

**Request:**
```
POST /parse
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "html": "<html><body><h1>Title</h1><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body></html>",
  "selector": "p"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "selector": "p",
  "count": 2,
  "results": ["Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 2"]
}
```

---

## Running with Docker

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t cheerio-api .
docker run --rm -p 4444:3000 cheerio-api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:4444`.

---

## Usage Examples

### A) Testing the API with `/hello`

Open the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:4444/hello
```

This confirms the container is running and responding.

---

### B) Using `curl` to Test `/parse`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4444/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "html": "<html><body><h1>Hello</h1><p>First</p><p>Second</p></body></html>",
    "selector": "p"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "selector": "p",
  "count": 2,
  "results": ["First", "Second"]
}
```

---

### C) Example for an n8n HTTP Request Node

Configure the n8n HTTP Request Node as follows:

- **HTTP Method:** POST  
- **URL:** `http://cheerio-api:3000/parse` (if n8n runs in the same Docker network)  
  or `http://localhost:4444/parse` (if running locally and port is exposed)  
- **Response Format:** JSON  
- **Content Type:** JSON  

**Body Parameters:**
```json
{
  "html": "<html><body><h1>Title</h1><p>Content</p></body></html>",
  "selector": "p"
}
```

The node will return:
```json
{
  "selector": "p",
  "count": 1,
  "results": ["Content"]
}
```

You can then use `{{$json["results"]}}` in subsequent nodes.
